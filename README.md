Caffeinated
-----------

A Windows app inspired by [Caffeine][1]. A small eye icon will appear in the System Tray which when toggled will enable and disable sleep. This project was originally created by [Desmond Brand][2] but was forked and is being updated by [TheJoeFin][3]. Part of the updates involved new icons which are still in the process of being refined. 

### How does it work
When initally launched the settings page shows up and an icon is added to the System Tray
![Settings page](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Caffeinated/blob/master/screenshots/Taskbar-and-Settings.jpg)

Clicking the icon in the System Tray will toggle Caffeinated on or off:

State | Default Icon
--- | ---
Active | ![On State icon](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Caffeinated/blob/master/screenshots/Active.jpg)
Inactive | ![Off State icon](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Caffeinated/blob/master/screenshots/Inactive.jpg)



The future plans of Caffeinated involve:
1. Match the Windows 10 UX style
2. Simplify the settings and options
3. Repo maintenance: updating screenshots, documenting plans, etc.

Now Caffeinated can be accessed for free through the Microsoft Store under the name [Windows Caffeinated][4].
